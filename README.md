# Learning to Parse Json

This was made as a side project in order to correctly understand how the dart:convert library worked. You can see various attempts at making the program parse a JSON file in the commit history...

## What I learned:
    - Parsing is relatively straight forward
    - The inner workings of the process of parsing (the 2 step: lexer and parser combo)
    - "Correct"/"best" way to format a JSON for my needs
    - Using a JSON as a database
